## VOC Analyzer for Lung Cancer

**Goal:**  
Engineer a handheld breath analyzer that detects **volatile organic compounds (VOCs)** linked to early-stage lung cancer using a hybrid sensor array and AI classification.

**Impact:**  
Lung cancer is often detected only after spreading, when survival rates drop below 20%. However, changes in VOC composition can occur **months to years earlier**. Current GC-MS testing is prohibitively expensive and confined to laboratories. This project translates that precision into a **portable device**, potentially transforming screening into a **simple breath test** available at clinics or homes.

**General Parts & Functionality:**  
Combines MOS, PID, and NDIR sensors in a controlled airflow system to detect unique VOC signatures. A microcontroller processes signals and sends results to a smartphone app for ML-based analysis.

**Roles Involved:**  
- **Hardware:** Assemble and calibrate sensors, flow control, and power system.  
- **Firmware:** Manage sampling sequences and signal collection.  
- **AI/ML:** Develop VOC pattern recognition and classification models.  
- **CAD Design:** Design hygienic, modular handheld enclosures.  
- **Research/Biology:** Correlate detected compounds with clinical lung cancer profiles.

**Benefits:**  
Enables **early, painless detection** before tumors form, reduces healthcare costs, and provides a scalable tool for global lung health screening.
