## Sleep Apnea Kit

**Goal:**  
Develop a portable, affordable system that continuously monitors blood oxygen, breathing patterns, heart rhythm, and brain activity during sleep to identify apnea episodes.

**Impact:**  
Sleep apnea affects over **25 million adults in the U.S. alone**, yet most remain **undiagnosed** because traditional polysomnography tests cost hundreds of dollars per night and require specialized clinics. This project makes diagnosis **accessible at home**, allowing early detection that prevents chronic fatigue, heart disease, and cognitive decline. By combining four biosensing modes (SpOâ‚‚, ECG, EEG, and sound), this kit offers **near-clinical accuracy** at a fraction of the cost, empowering both clinicians and everyday users.

**General Parts & Functionality:**  
Integrates oxygen, heart rate, sound, and EEG sensors with a microcontroller that logs overnight data and timestamps all readings for analysis.

**Roles Involved:**  
- **Hardware:** Assemble biosensors and amplifier circuitry for clean signal capture.  
- **Firmware:** Program synchronized data acquisition and storage routines.  
- **AI/ML:** Train models to detect apnea patterns from signal correlations.  
- **CAD Design:** Develop comfortable, durable headbands and clips.  
- **Research/Biology:** Map biosignals to apnea severity and physiological response.

**Benefits:**  
Provides an **early-warning system** for respiratory disorders, expands healthcare to rural and low-income populations, and encourages preventive sleep health monitoring.
