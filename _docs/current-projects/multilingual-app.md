# Multilingual Healthcare Communication App

**Goal:** Break language barriers between patients and healthcare providers through real-time translation.

## Summary
A cross-platform mobile app uses **speech-to-text**, **translation APIs**, and **text-to-speech** to enable multilingual medical conversations.  
The app securely logs transcripts and supports optional integration with mic and speaker hardware for a standalone translator device.  
The long-term vision is a **medical-specific translation platform** for clinics and international health volunteers.

## Roles
- **Software:** Develop Flutter/React front-end, integrate translation APIs, design UI/UX.  
- **Firmware (optional):** Configure mic/speaker hardware for dedicated device operation.  
- **AI/ML:** Fine-tune translation or speech models for healthcare-specific terms.  
- **Research/Biology:** Curate medically relevant phrases and ensure clinical terminology accuracy.
