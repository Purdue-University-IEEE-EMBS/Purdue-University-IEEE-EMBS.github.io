## Tri-Modal Home Kit (Alzheimer’s & Parkinson’s)

**Goal:**  
Design a unified home monitoring system that captures **motion, speech, and eye-tracking data** to identify early symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases.

**Impact:**  
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s often go **undiagnosed for years**, until irreversible brain changes occur. Clinical detection relies on expensive imaging and specialist visits unavailable to many. This project aims to democratize neurological screening through a **$100 wearable device** capable of tracking tremors, gait, voice modulation, and eye behavior — key indicators of disease progression.

**General Parts & Functionality:**  
Combines a motion sensor (IMU), microphone, and IR camera to measure motor control, speech coherence, and pupil dynamics — all processed by a Raspberry Pi Zero for phone-based analysis.

**Roles Involved:**  
- **Hardware:** Integrate multi-modal sensors into compact wearable units.  
- **Firmware:** Ensure time-synchronized data collection and power efficiency.  
- **AI/ML:** Build cross-sensor learning models for tremor and cognitive detection.  
- **CAD Design:** Prototype comfortable wrist and visor enclosures.  
- **Research/Biology:** Define measurable neurophysiological markers of disease.

**Benefits:**  
Promotes **early diagnosis and home monitoring**, helping slow disease progression through early intervention and allowing clinicians to track patients remotely.
