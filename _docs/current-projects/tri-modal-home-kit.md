# Tri-Modal Home Kit (Alzheimer’s / Parkinson’s)

**Goal:** Develop a wearable system to track tremors, speech, and eye movement for early neurological screening.

## Summary
The kit combines a **wrist-worn IMU** for motion tracking, a **MEMS microphone** for speech analysis, and an **IR camera + LED visor** for eye tracking.  
The **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** synchronizes and transmits data to a mobile app. Together, these sensors capture tremor frequency, voice modulation, and pupil movement—core indicators of cognitive and motor decline.

## Roles
- **Hardware:** Connect IMU, microphone, and IR camera modules; wire power and communication lines.  
- **Firmware:** Implement sensor fusion, data timestamping, and wireless data transmission.  
- **AI/ML:** Analyze multimodal data to classify tremor patterns or speech changes.  
- **Research/Biology:** Review clinical studies linking motor/speech metrics to disease progression.  
- **CAD/Design:** Prototype ergonomic wristbands and lightweight visors for daily wear.
