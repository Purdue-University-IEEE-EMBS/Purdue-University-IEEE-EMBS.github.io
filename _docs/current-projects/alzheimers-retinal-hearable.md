## Alzheimer’s Retinal Scan / Hearable

**Goal:**  
Create a dual-function diagnostic platform using **retinal imaging and in-ear biosensing** to screen for Alzheimer’s disease non-invasively.

**Impact:**  
Alzheimer’s diagnosis typically requires costly brain imaging or post-symptom cognitive testing. This project combines **ophthalmic imaging** and **hearable biosensors** to detect neural and vascular biomarkers through the eye and ear — two of the body’s most accessible diagnostic windows. The innovation lies in pairing low-cost hardware with smartphone AI models to deliver **clinic-level insights anywhere**, helping detect disease years before memory loss begins. 

**General Parts & Functionality:**  
Uses an IR fundus camera for retinal scans or an earbud with EEG/PPG sensors for neural and blood-flow monitoring; data sent to a phone app for AI-driven analysis.

**Roles Involved:**  
- **Hardware:** Design optical imaging and in-ear sensor systems.  
- **Firmware:** Capture and transmit multi-signal data to mobile interfaces.  
- **AI/ML:** Train diagnostic models on retinal patterns and EEG features.  
- **CAD Design:** Create compact, patient-friendly form factors.  
- **Research/Biology:** Link retinal/EEG biomarkers to Alzheimer’s pathology.

**Benefits:**  
Makes **neurological screening affordable, portable, and preventive**, enabling annual home-based checkups that can revolutionize early dementia detection.
