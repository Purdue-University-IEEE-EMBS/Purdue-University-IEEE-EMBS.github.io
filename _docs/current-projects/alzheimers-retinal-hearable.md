# Alzheimer’s Retinal Scan / Hearable

**Goal:** Create dual-mode tools for early Alzheimer’s detection through retinal imaging and in-ear biosensing.

## Summary
This project has two branches.  
The **retinal scanner** uses a +20 D fundus lens and Pi NoIR camera to image retinal biomarkers under IR light.  
The **hearable module** embeds EEG/PPG sensors (MAX30102) in a soft earbud to capture neural and circulatory signals.  
Both systems connect to a shared smartphone app for AI analysis, providing portable, non-invasive screening.

## Roles
- **Hardware:** Assemble LED illumination circuits, integrate sensors (EEG/PPG), and configure Pi/Arduino systems.  
- **Firmware:** Handle camera capture, signal amplification, and BLE data transfer.  
- **AI/ML:** Train models to detect retinal or in-ear signal changes correlated with cognitive decline.  
- **Research/Biology:** Validate biomarkers and interpret physiological meaning of anomalies.  
- **CAD/Design:** Build custom housings for the earbud and optical adapter.
